# Theme Toggler App 🌗

A simple React application with a **dark mode toggle** built using **React Context API**, **localStorage**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app supports system preference detection and persists the theme across browser refreshes.

## Features ✨
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes dynamically.
- **State Persistence**: Saves the theme preference using `localStorage`.
- **System Preference Detection**: Defaults to the user's system theme if no preference is saved.
- **Dynamic Icons**: Changes the toggle button icon (Sun/Moon) based on the current theme.

## Tech Stack 💻
- **React**: Frontend framework for building UI components.
- **React Context API**: Manages global state for the theme.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design, dark mode styling, and animations.
- **React Icons**: For theme toggle icons.

## Installation 🛠️

   git clone https://github.com/Hamzah840/theme-toggler.git
